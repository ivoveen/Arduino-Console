# The Arduino Console - Game Mania

![arduinoConsolePromo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29e7c9df-2e39-43b4-b249-d0592ccd428a)

This was a project made by a group of 4 people for our final year of highschool.
The goal was to make a handheld console using the arduino that had a few games on it.
That is exactly what we ended up creating. The console had a LED matrix display and a joystick and two buttons.
The case of the console was modeled and 3d printed to fit perfectly around the inside logistics.

The console itself had a startup animation, a main menu and 4 games.
The games were Snake(Ivo), Dino Jump(Ivo), Guitar-hero(Asrin) and an original game about timing called Whack(Thomas).
Besides this the console was painted and some research documents had to be written as part of our grade.

In the end we got a good grade and got to show it off at a project market. 
Where loads of people came to try out the handheld and we handed out small prizes to people who beat highscores. 

### Work done by Ivo and general code info
I, (Ivo) was responsible for putting together the hardware of the console. 
Furthermore, I also created 2 out of the 4 games (Snake and Dino Jump) and set up the main menu and software architecture of the code.
**The code is by no means a good example of how an arduino console should be made** but it got the job done. 
Everything is contained in one big .ino file which houses the four games and main menu. 
The graphics where hardcoded sprites assigning each LED a colour in a maximum 8x8 grid. 
To test the games the person who was working had to have the arduino console with them physically so we rotated around passing the console to whoever had time to work on the project.
